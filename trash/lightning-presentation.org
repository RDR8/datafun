* Functional query languages
** "Like SQL, but functional"
** Query lang: manipulate + answer Q's about data
** Recipe: Pure, total FP plus sets + set comprehensions
** ≈ relational algebra

* Recursive queries (Datalog)
** eg. given edges, determine reachability
** Recursive, but total
** Semantics: Fixed points of *monotone* maps on sets
** Q: Types for monotonicity?
** A: Poset is CCC → models simply typed λ-calculus!

* Mixed tonicity
** But want monotone *and* non-monotone functions!
** Adjoint calculus
*** Given: semantic categories w/ an adjunction
*** Get: typing rules for a language expressing both
*** Benton-Wadler "Linear logic, monads & the lambda calculus"
** TWO variable contexts: unrestricted Δ & monotone Γ
*** Δ;Γ ⊢ e : t
*** AUDIENCE: Best way to do this as embedded DSL?

* What can Datafun express?
** relational algebra
** static analyses
** shortest path in a graph
** parse arbitrary CFGs (CYK algorithm)
** & we're not even Turing complete!

* Monotonicity - functoriality connection?
** Could this be useful for generic programming?
