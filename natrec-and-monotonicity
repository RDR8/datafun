-- woah, how did that happen? induction broke our monotonicity guarantee!

-- **what's the type of natrec?**
-- what justifies inductive datastructures in a monotone setting?
-- does Poset have all initial algebras?
-- (what the hell are subobject classifiers?)

-- what is this monotone in?
-- if z <= s z, then it's monotone in n (and s?)
-- if s z <= z, then it's antitone in n
