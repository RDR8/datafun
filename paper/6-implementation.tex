\section{Implementation}
We have built a proof-of-concept implementation of Datafun in Racket
\todo{CITE}. In addition to core Datafun, it supports pattern-matching, variant
types, record types, subtyping, antitone functions, and unbounded (potentially
nonterminating) fixed points. It performs no optimizations whatsoever.
