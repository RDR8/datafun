\section{Implementation}
We have built a proof-of-concept implementation of Datafun in Racket
\todo{CITE}. In addition to core Datafun, it supports pattern-matching, variant
types, record types, dictionaries, subtyping, antitone functions, and unbounded
(potentially nonterminating) fixed points. It performs no optimizations
whatsoever.

\todo{explain subtyping?}
\todo{explain antitonicity?}
\todo{explain ordering on dictionaries?}
