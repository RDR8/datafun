- put patterns in more places!
  - make pattern-match failure in a for loop exclude the item?

- implement irrefutable-pattern? & use it appropriately
  - needed for using patterns to destructure monotone values in case-expressions

- implement set-comprehensions? for/set?

- augment for to understand when-clauses AND/OR iteration over booleans

- implement e-case-mono?
- implement antitonicity? (e-case-anti?)

EVENTUALLY
- implement polymorphism
