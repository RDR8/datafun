- better support for polymorphic primitives. currently, when applying
  polymorphic primitives, have to type-annotate the primitive itself. solutions:

  - replace e-prim with e-prim-apply, representing "fully apply a primitive to
    arguments". change parsing to cope, and make type inference work on these.

  - upgrade type system to handle polymorphism, including lattice-polymorphism.
    we'll want this in the long run anyway. how hard would it be?

    after some thought: quite hard. let's do the e-prim-apply thing.
